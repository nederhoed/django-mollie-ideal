================================ 
Mollie/iDEAL Payments for Django
================================

This package provides a Python interface to the iDEAL API by Mollie.nl
for use in Django projects. It requires Python 2.5 or higher.

iDEAL is a payment system used in the Netherlands which allows Dutch
consumers to make online payments via the secure environment of their
own bank.

Mollie.nl provide a unified API which removes the complexity of
interacting with the individual Dutch banks which support iDEAL
payments. You can find detailed information about the Mollie.nl iDEAL
API at
http://www.mollie.nl/support/documentatie/betaaldiensten/ideal/en/ 

Full information and installation instructions can be found in
README.rst

NOTE: This is a Bitmymoney fork of the original django-mollie-ideal project,
to make sure we do not receive unexpected (malicious or otherwise) changes
and to have better control over availability. If you want to use this
software for non-BMM projects, we strongly advise using the original
project's code.
